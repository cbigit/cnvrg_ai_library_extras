#  cnvrg AI Library "Extras" Component repo

Use the Template to create your own repo. 

Each directory is a seperate component. 

Add to your personal cnvrg.io environment by simply cloning this project and for each component you wish to add 

```
cd directory_of_component
cnvrg library import
```

That's all you will see the component in your AI Library and can now use these from your workspace or in Flows you create.
